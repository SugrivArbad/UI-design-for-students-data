# UI-design-for-students-data
I have used Javascript, JQuery, HTML/CSS for displaying, adding, deleting, storing data of students.

Usage : 
  students_main.html is a main file. 
  to execute it :
  1] open your browser and in URL type this
        file://<file-path>/students_main.html
  OR
  2] you can run this command on shell of linux.
        $ cd <directory-path>
        $ <browser-name> students_main.html
